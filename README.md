### About 
This repository houses the final project report written for my Software Engineering class. The project involved creating a bus system application that allows users to get real-time Rutgers bus information. 
I was involved with documenting this project through diagramming. Specifically, I created the use-case diagram, the sequence diagram, the architectural design diagram, the activity diagram, and the class diagram.
More information about the project in the report "Rutgers Bus System Manager Final Report".
